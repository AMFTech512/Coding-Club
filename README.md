# Coding-Club

Coding Club is a club about coding.
This website provides some examples of code.
It will later feature programs from other members of the club.

FOR ADDING NEW HTML FILES:

If you wanted to add some html file called 'cool.html', and have the link to it say 'Really Cool', then you must also edit <a href='index.html'>index.html</a> in your pull request. You must use the 'a' tag in html, setting the href property of it to the file path that leads to your html file.

Also, please put each of your projects in the folder 'coding-club-projects', and then create a folder within it that is titled with the first three letters of your first name and the first three letters of your last name. If your name was Hedre Uuhnm Hpppppp, then the path to your programs would be Coding-Club/coding-club-projects/hedhpp

Please follow this structure, or Mr. Spooky JosCla will not accept your pull request!!!
