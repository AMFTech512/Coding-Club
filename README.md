# Coding-Club

Coding Club is a club about coding.
This website provides some examples of code.
It will later feature programs from other members of the club.

FOR ADDING NEW HTML FILES:

If you wanted to add some html file called 'cool.html', and have the link to it say 'Really Cool', then you should add this to index.html:

<a href='cool.html'>Really Cool</a>

This will, upon clicking the link, redirect the user to whatever is contained within the href, whether it is a link to a website, or in this case, a file path. So, if you put the html file in question within a folder called 'waypastcool', then the addition to index.html would instead be:

<a href='waypastcool/cool.html'>Really Cool</a>
