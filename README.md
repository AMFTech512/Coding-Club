This website provides some examples of code.

FOR ADDING NEW HTML FILES:

If you wanted to add some html file called 'cool.html', and have the link to it say 'Really Cool', then you must also edit <a href='index.html'>index.html</a> in your pull request. You must use the 'a' tag in html, setting the href property of it to the file path that leads to your html file.
